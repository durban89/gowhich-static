**Points vs. Pixels**  
The iPhone 4 introduced a high resolution display with twice the pixels of previous iPhones. However you don't have to modify your code to support high-res displays; the coordinate system goes by points rather than pixels, and the dimensions in points of the screen and all UI elements remain the same.  
iOS 4 supports high resolution displays (like the iPhone 4 display) via the scale property on UIScreen, UIView, UIImage, and CALayer classes. If the object is displaying high-res content, its scale property is set to 2.0. Otherwise it defaults to 1.0.  
All you need to do to support high-res displays is to provide @2x versions of the images in your project. See the [checklist for updating to iOS4](http://www.idev101.com/code/Distribution/updating_ios4.html#l2) or Apple documentation for [Supporting High Resolution Screens](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/SupportingHiResScreens/SupportingHiResScreens.html) for more info.
